# Bengine

## What it is ***RIGHT NOW***
Currently, Bengine is a blank GLFW window. The engine structure at a high level is laid out, but needs to be implemented. Come back later when I've actually worked on this enough for features to be there.

## What it's going to be
Bengine is the beginnings of a game engine made from pretty bare bones OpenGL, GLFW, and GLEW in C++ and C. The end goal of this engine is a platform for me to develop games in a space I am completely familiar with and that emphasizes low-level, very versatile usage over complicated and rigid abstracted engines.

## What it's not going to be
Bengine is not an all purpose game engine. This is not trying to be unity or unreal, it's just trying to be highly useful for the games I want to make. This will likely include both 2D and 3D (although 2D is more important), and will *not* include scripting or fully integrated modeling/animation or very much UI. Using this engine will rely heavily on your knowledge of C++, C, GLSL, OpenGL, graphics techniques, etc. but should you know how to weild these things, you're rewarded with a high level of control over optimization and engine parameters.
